# Batter's Box

Many years ago I wrote and released an iOS app (iPhone/iPad) that used the MLB API to show live scoring and other information. I was asked to take it down by MLBAM and I complied, but a few thousand loyal users have kept using it until iOS 11 ended 32-bit app support.

The code has languished for years, but recently a friend took it and got it running under Xcode 8+. It's ugly (both visually and code-wise), but here's a Batter's Box you can compile for yourself that works on iOS 11.

Some rough instructions to get it running on your device:

* Download Xcode
* Open the xcodeproj file
* On the left click the Batter's Box icon at the top of the sidebar, then click the dropdown next to "Team" to select your personal team. If you do not have a personal team yet be sure to log into your Apple ID in the Accounts section of the Xcode preferences.
* Once the certs are provisioned you can plug your device into your computer and then select it from the dropdown (to the right of the stop button in the top bar. Past the application icon that says Batter's Box).

UI improvements, code improvements, documentation improvements are all welcome.
